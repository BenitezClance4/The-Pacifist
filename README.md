# Lore

Following the success of the ZM7 and the Vulcanette, an unknown
company was experimenting for a high-capacity 7mm machine gun with
a unique box magazine no longer requiring ammo links and firing
at a steady pace, approximately 420 rounds per minute. It was
named MG-276 Medium Machine Gun at the time being. It made a decent
reputation as a support weapon. It was criticized for lacking an
ammo converter at one point and made a new model with the converter
but this time it converts faster than an average 7mm converter but
more vulnerable to malfunction and converts up to 40 rounds. For an
unknown reason, it got a spike of popularity to the point Volt-UAC
bought the patent from the company behind the gun and made a deal
of making a share from the sales and the gun having the nickname
"The Pacifist". Its current problems are that the gun and the
magazine being excruciatingly heavy, and lacking a scope to deal
with distant targets.
